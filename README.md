**Motivation** 
==============

Prime numbers are 'Prime'. They piqued my interest.

Prime number generation is non-trivial. Sieves are a good help.

**Vatsan Spiral QR**
===================
A pixel-ated version of Vatsan spiral 51 x 51! Look deep to view patterns in primes!

This repo in Git is about creating a simple approach towards understanding primes in a better way.


**Request**
===========

All readers are requested to view the code, provide valuable comments either in my blog or here in git.

I will try my best to add as many features as possible.
