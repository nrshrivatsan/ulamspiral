#Why

Prime numbers greater than 7 end with one of the following digits

> 1 3 7 9

I just call them peds = Prime Ending Digits

Given that.

Could we detect patterns in the ending digits of primes and then narrow into combinatorics of last but one and last. And eventually crack the code.

This folder has code moving toward that.

#Questions yet to be answered

- Are there patterns in peds in twin primes?
- Are there patterns in peds themselves leading to conjectures?
- Are there patterns in peds of large size primes like Messner Primes?
- Could color coded Ulam Spiral with a unique color per PED give better patterns?
- Could color coded Vatsan Spiral with a unique color per PED give better patterns?
